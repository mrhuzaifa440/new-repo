One of the most popular choices is the classic box of crayons. Crayons offer a wide range of colors and are easy for kids to grip and maneuver. They are also non-toxic and can be easily washed off surfaces, making them a parent's best friend. Another option is markers, which are known for their vibrant and bold hues. Markers provide smooth coloring and are great for filling in larger areas. Additionally, colored pencils are a great choice for children who want more control and precision in their coloring. These pencils offer a variety of shades and can be sharpened for fine details.
