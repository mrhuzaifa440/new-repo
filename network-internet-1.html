                    <h2>Network</h2><p>Today's interconnected world relies heavily on networks to facilitate communication and exchange of information. A network can be defined as a system of interconnected devices or nodes that work together to share resources and enable communication. These networks can be both local, such as a home or office network, or global, such as the internet. The strength and efficiency of a network depend on factors like its architecture, protocols, and hardware components.<br/><br/>One crucial aspect of a network is its scalability. A network must be able to adapt and expand as the number of connected devices or users grows. This scalability ensures that the network can handle increasing demands for data transmission and processing. Additionally, network security plays a pivotal role in safeguarding sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. Various security mechanisms, such as firewalls and encryption protocols, are employed to protect networks from potential threats. Ultimately, in today's digital age, a robust and secure network is essential for seamless connectivity and efficient data exchange across various platforms.</p><h2>Internet</h2><p>The Internet has become an integral part of modern society. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. With just a few clicks, people can connect with others from around the world, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. The Internet has also made it easier for individuals to stay informed, as news and updates are just a search away. From social media platforms to online shopping, the Internet offers endless opportunities for entertainment, education, and convenience.<br/><br/>One of the key advantages of the Internet is its vast amount of information. From academic journals to online encyclopedias, there is a wealth of knowledge available at our fingertips. This accessibility has not only benefited students and researchers, but it has also empowered individuals to become self-taught in various fields. Additionally, the Internet has enabled people to stay connected with friends and family through social media platforms and instant messaging apps. It has bridged geographical gaps and brought people closer together, regardless of distance. The Internet truly is a powerful tool that has transformed the way we live and interact on a global scale.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is a network?</h3><p>A network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and routers, that can communicate and share resources with each other.</p><h3>What is the internet?</h3><p>The internet is a global network of networks that allows connected devices worldwide to communicate and exchange information using standard protocols.</p><h3>How does the internet work?</h3><p>The internet works by routing data packets between different networks using a technology called the Internet Protocol (IP).
