By carefully monitoring the nesting activities and protecting the nesting zones, scientists and conservationists are able to ensure the survival and growth of these marine animals. <br/><br/>The nesting process of sea turtles takes place on sandy beaches, where the mother turtle carefully selects the site to lay her eggs. The abiotic factors such as temperature, moisture levels, and proximity to the water play a crucial role in determining the success of the nest. Once the eggs are laid, they are left to incubate under the sand. During this time, they are vulnerable to a variety of biotic and abiotic factors that can affect their survival. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of organizations like Marinelife, these nests are protected from human disturbances and predators, ensuring a safe and nurturing environment for the hatchlings. By preserving the nesting grounds and monitoring the health of these nests, scientists and conservationists are able to contribute to the conservation of marine life and the overall health of our oceans.</p>
