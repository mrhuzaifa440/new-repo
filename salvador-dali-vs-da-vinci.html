<h3>Understanding the Artistic Styles of Both Masters</h3><p>Salvador Dali and Da Vinci were both renowned artists, yet their artistic styles showcased distinct differences. Dali, known for his surrealist paintings, pushed the boundaries of traditional art and challenged viewers' perceptions. His famous piece, "The Persistence of Memory," depicts melting clocks in a dream-like scene, while his eccentricities are evident in works such as "The Sacrament of the Last Supper," which portrays the disciples with elongated faces.
